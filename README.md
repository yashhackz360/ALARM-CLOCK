Alarm Clock
This Python project implements an alarm clock using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. Users can set a specific alarm time and receive a notification when the alarm time matches the current time. The application utilizes threading to run the alarm function in the background, ensuring accurate time tracking without freezing the interface.
To use the alarm clock:
Run the alarm_clock.py script.
Set the desired alarm time by selecting the hour, minute, and second.
Click the "Set Alarm" button to activate the alarm.
When the set time is reached, a sound will play to alert you.
This project is a practical example of how to create a basic alarm clock application in Python, suitable for learning about GUI programming with Tkinter and implementing simple time-based functionalities. Feel free to explore and modify the code to customize the alarm clock according to your preferences.
